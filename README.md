Hello!

I'm Matt, though I'd prefer if you called me Athaeus. I am what I like calling an <i>aspiring everything</i>, because I'm into just so many things. These would onclude:
💻 Programming (duh), 🎨 Art, ⚔️ History, 🗣️ Linguistics and all the world's languages, 📖 Writing, storytelling and worldbuilding, 🎼 Music, 🎮 Gaming,
💫 Animation (mostly anime :p), 🎬 Filmmaking, and 🌟 Astrophysics. I love to code, I love to draw, I love to write and I love to read, and I somtimes make conlangs.
I also play video games, like the Total War series, Crusader Kings 2, Kerbal Space Program, RimWorld etc.

I'm learning to code in C++, C#, and Python. I'm learning game development in the Unity 3D game engine thanks to the amazing people at GameDev.TV. I'd also very much like to
create a game engine of my own for a future project. But bloody hell, are those too ambitious for me right now!

I'm also learning a few languages right now. Well, I'm 🇵🇱 Polish, so I had to learn 🇬🇧 English from scratch. I'm also learning 🇷🇺 Russian, 🇩🇪 German, 🇯🇵 Japanese, and 🇨🇿 Czech.

I'm not really looking to start a cooperative project at this point because, well, firstly I'm hella introverted, and secondly my skill set is rather incomplete at this time.
Nevertheless, if you ever want to contact me, check me out on Twitter @easternPeasant (preferred) or @Athaeus, or e-mail me at my adress:
mtjkl.game@gmail.com

Stay safe andhave a great day!
