Hello!

I'm Matt, currently a 2nd year student in Legal Studies (of all things). I like calling myself an <i>aspiring everything</i>, since I'm into just so many things. These would include:
💻 Programming (duh), 🎨 Art, ⚔️ History, 🗣️ Linguistics and language learning, 📖 Writing, storytelling and worldbuilding, 🎼 Music, 🎮 Gaming,
💫 Animation, 🎬 Filmmaking, and 🌟 Astrophysics.
I also play video games, like the Total War series, Paradox grand strategy, Kerbal Space Program, RimWorld etc.

Currently learning programming and game development. My set goals are: decent knowledge in algorithms and data structures, fluency in C++, C#, Python and GDScript, mastering game design and game art. I'm learning game development in Unity 3D and Godot Engine thanks to the amazing people at GameDev.TV.

I'm also a language learner. 🇵🇱 Polish is my native tongue, and I have C2-level fluency in 🇬🇧 English. I know basic 🇷🇺 Russian and rudimentary 🇩🇪 German. I'm learning 🇯🇵 Japanese.
